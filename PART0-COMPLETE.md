# PART 0 - Infrastructure Setup ✅ COMPLETE

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Repository Structure
- Created complete microservices architecture with 4 main services:
  - `backend/` - API Gateway (Node.js + Fastify)
  - `workers/` - Worker Cluster (Node.js)
  - `vendor-sim/` - Vendor Simulator (Express)
  - `frontend/` - Next.js React Application

### ✅ Package Management
- Created `package.json` files for all services with proper dependencies
- Configured scripts for development, production, and testing
- Set up proper Node.js project structure

### ✅ Environment Configuration
- Created `.env.example` files for all services
- Configured environment variables for:
  - Database connections (MongoDB)
  - Kafka/Redpanda message broker
  - Authentication (JWT, Google OAuth)
  - AI services (OpenAI)
  - Vendor simulator settings

### ✅ Docker Infrastructure
- Created `docker-compose.yml` for local development
- Set up MongoDB with initialization scripts
- Configured Redpanda (Kafka-compatible) message broker
- Created Dockerfiles for all services
- Set up proper networking and volume management

### ✅ Database Setup
- Created MongoDB initialization script with:
  - Collection schemas and validation
  - Proper indexes for performance
  - Sample data structure for leads, orders, segments, campaigns, etc.

### ✅ Basic Service Implementation
- **Backend**: Health endpoints, basic API structure
- **Workers**: Basic worker framework ready for expansion
- **Vendor Sim**: SMS/Email simulator with callback functionality
- **Frontend**: Next.js app with Tailwind CSS, basic status page

### ✅ Development Tools
- Created Makefile for easy service management
- Added verification and testing scripts
- Set up proper logging and health checks
- Created comprehensive README with setup instructions

## Verification Results

All services tested and working:
- ✅ Backend API: `http://localhost:3000/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- ✅ Vendor Simulator: `http://localhost:3001/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- ✅ All package.json files valid
- ✅ All required files and directories present
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration ready

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
make install

# 2. Start all services
make start

# 3. Verify setup
node scripts/verify-setup.js

# 4. Test health endpoints
make health
```

## Service URLs (when running)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3000
- **Vendor Simulator**: http://localhost:3001  
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3002
- **MongoDB**: localhost:27017
- **Redpanda**: localhost:19092

## Next Steps (Part 1)
Ready to proceed with:
1. Authentication system (Google OAuth)
2. MongoDB models and database connections
3. Data ingestion endpoints
4. Basic API endpoints for leads and orders

## Architecture Overview
```
Frontend (Next.js) ↔ API Gateway (Node.js) ↔ Kafka (Redpanda) ↔ Worker Cluster ↔ MongoDB
```

The foundation is solid and ready for building the core CRM functionality!
