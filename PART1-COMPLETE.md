## API Examples

### **Create High Spenders Segment**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/segments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "High Spenders",
    "owner_user_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "rule_ast": {
      "type": "condition",
      "field": "total_spend",
      "operator": ">",
      "value": 1000
    }
  }'
```

### **Preview Segment**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/segments/preview \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rule_ast": {
      "op": "AND",
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "condition",
          "field": "total_spend",
          "operator": ">",
          "value": 1000
        },
        {
          "type": "condition",
          "field": "visits",
          "operator": "<",
